# Achilles
CLCV 115 Final project

This game was created using the pygame tech stack. It follows the greatest warrior ever, Achilles, as he battles in the trojan war.

I created a corresponding essay that goes along with this game that explains my inspiration for creating the game and why certain features were implemented. The essay is linked here: file:///C:/Users/micha/Downloads/Final%20Project%20Essay.pdf

# Install the game

In order to install the game, first you must clone this repository to your local device through the use of a command prompt in an IDE using the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Michael200344/Achilles.git
```
Once you have cloned the repository, you need to open the terminal in your IDE of choice and run the main game file. To do this, simply enter into the terminal:
```
py main.py
```
If you get an error at this point in time, it is likely because you do not have python or pygame installed on your local device. In order to install it, follow the steps on the link below and then try the previous step again.

# Goals
- Add different modes: easy, medium, hard, impossible. Then adjust player health, enemy speed, enemy damage and winning score accordingly.
- Add Arrows that come from the left side of the screen that the player must avoid by jumping over them. If one hits player, they die instantly.
- Add some more attibutes to the main menu so that the user can select game difficulty.
- If the user gets the winning score, play an audio file, change the display on the screen and finally end the game to show that user has won.
- Add an attack cool down.
- Add powerups that fall from the sky: increase health, increase score, temporarily slow down enemies.
