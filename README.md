# Goals

- Add Arrows that come from the left side of the screen that the player must avoid by jumping over them. If one hits player, they die instantly.
- Add some more attibutes to the main menu so that the user can select game difficulty.
- If the user gets the winning score, play an audio file, change the display on the screen and finally end the game to show that user has won.
- Allow the player to walk to the left and to move right while jumping.
